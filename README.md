* Wolfram Language

### If you want to contribute:  
1. Pick a language to create a factorial program for
2. Make sure that it hasn't been done in that language already
3. Create the factorial program in that language
4. Fork the project and create a pull request
5. Title the pull request with the language you are committing
6. Add extra info I should know to the description (like where to test the code, how to input the factorial, etc)
7. Wait for me to either accept or reject it (I'll try to tell you why I reject it if I did)
